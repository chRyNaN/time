val [Year](-year/index.md).[lastDate](last-date.md): LocalDate

Retrieves the last LocalDate of the [Year](-year/index.md), December 31st.

Note that this returns the last LocalDate of the [Year](-year/index.md) but it may not be the last LocalDate of the last week of the [Year](-year/index.md) as that is dependent on the [WeekFormat](-week-format/index.md).
