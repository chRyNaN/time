val [Year](-year/index.md).[firstDate](first-date.md): LocalDate

Retrieves the first LocalDate of the [Year](-year/index.md), January 1st.

Note that this returns the first LocalDate of the [Year](-year/index.md) but it may not be the first LocalDate of the first week of the [Year](-year/index.md) as that is dependent on the [WeekFormat](-week-format/index.md).
