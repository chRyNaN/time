(JVM, COMMON) `DayInMonth(value: `[`Int`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html)`)`

means that it is the first day of the month. Months have different amounts of days in them and some vary
(Ex: February during a leap year). Note that no check is done to assert that the provided [value](value.md) is valid when
constructing an instance of this class.
