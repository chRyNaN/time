(JVM, COMMON) `MinuteInHour(value: `[`Int`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html)`)`

Represents the minute within an hour for a Calendar day. This is an inline class wrapper around a numerical
representation of a hour. This could be a value starting from, and including, 0, up to, and excluding, 60. Note that
no check is performed to assert that the provided value is valid. Also, note that this class is different from the
[Minutes](../-minutes/index.md) class. Where the [Minutes](../-minutes/index.md) class denotes an amount of time or duration, this class denotes an exact minute
within an hour.
