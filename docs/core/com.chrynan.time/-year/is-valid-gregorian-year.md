# isValidGregorianYear

(JVM, COMMON) `val isValidGregorianYear: `[`Boolean`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-boolean/index.html)

Determines whether this [Year](index.md) is a valid year in the Gregorian Calendar according to the Common Era years
notation. For instance, the year 1 BCE is immediately followed by the year 1 CE. This means there is no year
with a value of zero. So this condition determines if the year is not zero.
