(JVM, COMMON) `Year(value: `[`Long`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-long/index.html)`)`

Represents a Calendar Year. This is an inline class wrapper around a numerical representation of a year. A negative
value denotes a year within the Before Common Era period. A value of zero is not a valid year with respect to the
Common Era but can be used if using with a different calendar era. Note that this is not a duration, this does not
represent an amount of years, but rather, represents an exact year within a calendar.
